# Env-DIY305
 A custom PCB implementation of the LTP305 as they are now discontinued.

## Info
the LTP305 is discontinued and I saw a project on hackaday where someone made their own LTP305 using 0201 LEDs on a DIP14 sized PCB so I thought since their pcb files were never released we can re-do it but open source it.

This is meant as a drop in replacement for the LTP305/TIL305 so we plan for it to work the same except without the diffuser cover and also with other colours.
